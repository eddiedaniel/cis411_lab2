## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
A containerized version of an application would be more benficial than an application that is local because you can then give access to someone else who wants to use the application for their own use. Using a containerized version allows for a smoother transition when it comes to sharing and running a specific application
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?

It allows us to see if specifc action is causing an erro at some point so you can instantly see if its working or not. If things run smootlhy each time then you know exactly where you are in the process.
